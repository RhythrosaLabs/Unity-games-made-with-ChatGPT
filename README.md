# Unity-games-made-with-ChatGPT
A collection of Unity game assets (sprites, scripts, etc) made entirely by ChatGPT.

After designing a GPT that specializes in automating large projects, each game was prompted with a single command, and all assets for each game (sprites, scripts, ReadMe) were then conceptualized entirely by ChatGPT then generated and provided in a single response. 

Each game includes at least 5 images (such as characters, levels, game objects) and at least 5 scripts (such as player controls, enemy attack, etc).
